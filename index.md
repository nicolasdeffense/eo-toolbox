In this website you will find all the **Jupyter Notebooks** that will help you to use programming to achieve a remote sensing project from the download of EO data and the collection of *in situ* data to the final relevant results !

> Jupyter Notebooks are notebooks that contain code blocks in addition to text and illustrations. They make it easy to see the output of your code!

In the framework of this course, we will only use **Python**, the most widely used programming language in the world.
Python is very efficient in the field of remote sensing but also in many other fields (industries, consulting, pharma, environmental modeling, ...)!
Everything we use in the course is **open-source**, which means you can use your scripts without any constraints and for free! Moreover, the libraries we will use are constantly evolving thanks to a large community of users. 

Depending on your project, some parts of the course will be more useful than others.
