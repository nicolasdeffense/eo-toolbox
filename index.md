In this section you will find all the **Jupyter Notebooks** that will help you to use programming to achieve a remote sensing project from A to Z.

> Jupyter Notebooks are notebooks that contain code blocks in addition to text and illustrations. They make it easy to see the output of your code!

In the framework of this course, we will only use **Python**, the most widely used programming language in the world.
Python is very efficient in the field of remote sensing but also in many other fields (industries, consulting, pharma, environmental modeling, ...)! 

Depending on your project, some parts of the course will be more useful than others.
