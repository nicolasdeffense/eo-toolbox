## What is Earth Engine?

Earth Engine is a platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, for academic, non-profit, business and government users.

Earth Engine hosts satellite imagery and stores it in a public data archive that includes historical earth images going back more than forty years. The images, ingested on a daily basis, are then made available for global-scale data mining.

Earth Engine also provides APIs and other tools to enable the analysis of large datasets.

## How do I get access?

To get access to Earth Engine, please fill out the form at [signup.earthengine.google.com](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/). You will receive an email titled *"Welcome to Google Earth Engine"* with instructions for getting started.

## What datasets are available?

We have a searchable data catalog, including the entire EROS (USGS/NASA) Landsat catalog, numerous MODIS datasets, Sentinel-1 data, NAIP data, precipitation data, sea surface temperature data, CHIRPS climate data, and elevation data.

Users can also upload their own data for analysis in Earth Engine, with full control over access.

## Can I use my own proprietary imagery and vector data?

Yes. Earth Engine enables you to upload your own raster and vector data (e.g. GeoTIFF or Shape files) for analysis.
